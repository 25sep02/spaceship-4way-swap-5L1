Space jet interactive animation project 2026.


----------------------------------------

- 5L27b -

Previous fully working version: "spaceship 2026a ('ss+ss-noFlare' swap)".
   Completed 5L26-2354.
   Has default brown rocket 'spaceship' with engine exhaust flare animation.
   Also has new 'G' key spaceship swap function to swap to a new 'no flare' model of the brown rocket with no exhaust flare animation (but with 3 frame spritesheet png animation for code compatibility). This fits on-screen movements like going backwards with F/R fwd/rev outer-space thruster like action.

Current fully working is the more complete version: "spaceship 4-way-swap; 5L27-2352 kpe-prj".

Version "spaceship 4-way-swap; 5L27-2352 kpe-prj" was started on base of "kpe project dev-snapshot 5L27-2244". The 4 ship models that the user can swap to with the 'G' key are: 1)spaceship; 2)spaceship_noFlare; 3)xwing; 4)xwing_noFlare.
   New feature is to add to 'G' spaceship swap new model: 'x-wing-noFlare'.
   Like with 'spaceship_no-flare', I can leave the rotate & turn-left & turn-right sprites un changed because they are the same as the prior option in the fixed rotation for 'x-wing'.
   Now that my code ship-swap with texture-property and custom-anim-property is working all around, I only need to update the code for setting properties in the 'G-swaap' switch statement code.

- Add preload 'ss_xwing_no-flare' for 'spaceship; xwing no-flare.png'
- Add scene_B canvas 'sprite_xwing_no_flare' for above texture and 'visible' off, flip off.
- Add scene_B canvas 'sprite_xwing_left_no_flare' for same above texture and 'visible' off, flip on.
- Add scene_B animation 'xwingFly_no-flare' for same above texture. Loop on, frame 0-2, 15fps.
- Add scene_B animation 'xwingFlyLeft_no-flare' for same above texture. Loop on, frame 0-2, 15fps.


 - Update ship type swapping code.
   *** Update the following:
              1) 'G-swap' code  <-- upd for future new ship types
              vv-- below items only need 1 time dev coding and no future changes! --vv
              2) initialize rotate and turn custom properties near top of create()
              3) code for left/right rotate
              4) code for 'T-turn'

     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -

The expanded development version is "kpe project dev-snapshot 5L27-2244".
   It adds a new spaceship model, the star wars x-wing.
   'G-swap' now rotates between spaceship with flare, no-flare, x-wing, and back around to flare.

The code is working with a few previous glitches all being fixed:

     1) On xwing, rotate and stop & xwing-noFlare shows instead of wxing-rxst1.
           This is probably the last frame of the rotate, which uses 'noFlare'.
        - --FIX-- In rotate stop handler replace hard coded anim key with new
              anim swap object and property:
              "if (animation.key === 'shipRotate') {" change to:
              "if (animation.key === this.sprite_ss_rotate.rotatekey) {   // new custom property for ship-type swapping"

        On xwing, rotate then turn leaves a visible sprite that should be hidden.
        - Same issue as 1)-a?

        On xwing, turn left then rotate - and all rotates start with ss-left,
           first rotate after turn should use ss-left, the all are ss-right.
        - Same issue as 1)-a?

        On xwing, turn left then rotate - and stop & move directions are reversed.
           Then turning right corrects the move direction but get +1 sprite.
        - Same issue as 1)-a?

        On xwing, turn left then rotate - and stop & xwing-noFlare shows instead of wxing-rxst1.
           This is probably the last frame of the rotate, which uses 'noFlare'.
           Doing a turn right now adds xw-right with flare. On move both sprites move.
        - Same issue as 1)-a?

     2) On 'G' cycle ss,nf,xw,ss and turn always shows xw instead of ss.
        - --FIX-- In 'G' swap xw2ss code add 6 lines for texture & anim swap back for ss.
        - See: "kpe 27-2150 fix G xw2ss"






----------------------------------------

- 5L26d -

Below code tested and works 5L26-2140.

The game starts with 'sprite_spaceship' and its 'spaceship' texture (which is loaded with 'spaceship.png') and 'shipFly' anim on screen.
   The 'currentShipType' is set to 'spaceship'.
   'T' turns ship to left and shows 'sprite_ss_left' (with 'flip' on) and its 'spaceship' texture (also loaded with 'spaceship.png') and 'shipFlyLeft' anim.

Pressing 'G' shows the same sprite as was on screen but with the texture and anim swapped to 'spaceship_no-flare' (which is loaded with 'spaceship; no-flare.png') and either 'shipFly_no-Flare' or 'shipFlyLeft_no-Flare' anim to match the previous ship type.
   This also sets 'currentShipType' to 'spaceship_no-flare'.
   Pressing 'G' again will show the next ship type. I plan to add the x-wing ship type in the future. Right now it just goes back to what it was before because there are only the two ship types at this point.
   Values used in code for currentShipType: 'spaceship' 'spaceship_no-flare'

- 5L26e:  (also see full notes for 5L26e-5L27 in: ***"- spaceship js 2026a 5L26e ship-swap notes.txt"***)

With spritesheet swapping working for spaceship/spaceship_no-flare, next I began adding the new 'spaceship; xwing.png' and 'spaceship_rotate; xwing.png' spritesheets.

 - -DONE- For consistency, rename 'spaceship rotate; xwing.png' to 'spaceship_rotate; xwing.png'.

 - -DONE- In scene_B preload:
   > Add spritesheets 'spaceship; xwing rxst.png' (as 'spaceship_xwing') and 'spaceship_rotate; xwing.png' (as 'spaceship_rotate_xwing'). Both as type 'spritesheet' and 176x96.

 - -DONE- In scene_B canvas (all 5 sprites at 939x466, visible off):
   > Add sprites 'sprite_xwing' (visible off) and 'sprite_xwing_left' (visible off, flip on), both with texture 'spaceship_xwing'.
   > Also add 'sprite_xwing_rotate' (visible off) with texture 'spaceship_rotate_xwing'.
   > Also add sprites 'sprite_xwing_turn_left' (visible off) and 'sprite_xwing_turn_right' (visible off), both with texture 'spaceship_rotate_xwing'. They will have different animations for left and right but are otherwise setup the same.

 - -DONE- In scene_B animations:
   > Add 'xwingFly': texture 'spaceship_xwing', frames 0-2, fps 15 loop on.
   > Add 'xwingFlyLeft': texture 'spaceship_xwing', frames 0-2, fps 15 loop on. (Canvas sprite 'sprite_xwing_left' is flipped left.)
   > Add 'xwingRotate': texture 'spaceship_rotate_xwing', frames 0-11, fps 5 loop on.
   > Add 'xwingTurnLeft': texture 'spaceship_rotate_xwing', frames 0-6, fps 5 loop off.
   > Add 'xwingTurnRight': texture 'spaceship_rotate_xwing', frames 6-11, fps 5 loop off.

"kpe 1615; no_flare 1preload 2sprites 2anims" - project folder with KPE saved draft for adding 'spaceship; no-flare.png' sprite to the spaceship project.

Starter content: "spaceship 2026a kpe-prj.zip"

Refer to info in: "g-ai; spaceship switching; design & code 5L25"

== Changes:
  - Add spaceship_no_flare preload object to load new asset 'spaceship; no-flare.png'.
  - Add 2 sprites in scene_B: sprite_spaceship_no_flare, sprite_ss_left_no_flare.
  - Add 2 animations in scene_B: shipFly_no_flare, shipFlyLeft_no_flare.
  - Add user input key 'G' and listener for 'key-up' to bottom of scene_B create().
  - Add text to scene_A for '[G] - Change type of spaceship.'

== Add to create() logic for data setup:
vvv----------- about line 40 add 1 code line, 3 comment lines
// At start run default ship looping-animation constantly.
// User can swap ship types. The sprites below are reused for
//   all ship types by swapping their texture and animation settings.
this.sprite_spaceship.play("shipFly");
this.sprite_ss_left.play("shipFlyLeft");
this.sprite_spaceship.visible = true;
this.sprite_ss_left.visible = false;
this.currentShipType = 'spaceship';  // default start-up ship
// Values used in code for currentShipType:
//    'spaceship' 'spaceship_no-flare'
^^^-----------

== Add create() logic for 'G' key press:
vvv-----------
// User input for [G] - Change type of spaceship.
this.G.on('up', () => {
    switch (this.currentShipType) {
    case 'spaceship':
        this.currentShipType = 'spaceship_no-flare'; // The ship type we are switching to.
        this.sprite_spaceship.setTexture('spaceship_no-flare');
        this.sprite_spaceship.play("shipFly_no-flare");
        this.sprite_ss_left.setTexture('spaceship_no-flare');
        this.sprite_ss_left.play("shipFlyLeft_no-flare");
        break;
    case 'spaceship_no-flare':
        this.currentShipType = 'spaceship'; // The ship type we are switching to.
        this.sprite_spaceship.setTexture('spaceship');
        this.sprite_spaceship.play("shipFly");
        this.sprite_ss_left.setTexture('spaceship');
        this.sprite_ss_left.play("shipFlyLeft");
        break;
    }
 });
// Values used in code for currentShipType:
//    'spaceship' 'spaceship_no-flare'
^^^-----------



----------------------------------------

>> 5L26a:

In update method, optimized code for 'thrust move' and 'D-move' by using spriteGroup for simplicity and reducing trig math to 2x/upd (ie 1 for X and 1 for Y values) instead of 10x/upd (ie 2 * #of_sprites).

Also only do 'thrust move' trig math and moves if speed is not 0.




----------------------------------------

>> 5L24:

Added an alternate default spaceship 3-cell sprite sheet: "spaceship no-flare.png".

Rename this to the default "spaceship.png" when the rocket exhaust flare does not fit the animation intended. Especially for the new move feature for 'F'-forward and 'R'-reverse. No flare may work with 'F' and with 'R' while the default with the exhaust flare may not work with 'R'.

The rotate sprite sheet already has no exhaust flare so can work generally.

In the future, if I make sprite-sheets for other spaceships (for example star wars xwing and tie fighter spaceships) it may be a good idea to start with no-flare versions. I can always add an optional 'fly' sprite-sheet with exhaust flare as an add-on.


>> 5L24b:

Also added a new spaceship alternative to the default. The new spaceship is the star wars x-wing space rocket-jet. It has 2 versions of animated rocket exhaust, one full length and on with shorter exhaust but larger xwing. There is also a 'no-flare' version and a 'rotate' sprite-sheet.

The file names are:
  - 'spaceship rotate; xwing.png'
  - 'spaceship; xwing no-flare.png'
  - 'spaceship; xwing rxst.png'
  - 'spaceship; xwing rxst2.png'

Right now the only way to swap in a 'no-flare' alt, or an entirely new spaceship alt is to replace the run time files 'spaceship.png' and 'spaceship rotate.png' with the version you want to see when you start the game.

In the future I may ask ai to see if I can use the phaser.io js 'load'-sprite function to load the in-code sprite with different '.png' files depending on user input, then add an on-screen text like 'Choose spaceship - Press 1 for brown-spaceship. Press 2 for x-wing spaceship.'.





----------------------------------------

>> 5L23:

Added a second 'move' feature. The first move feature is 'D' to move forward at a fixed speed while the 'D' key is held down.

The new move feature is 'F'-forward and 'R'-reverse. This sets a continuous velocity that is updated every frame in the update() section. In the init() section a speed 'object-variable' for each sprite is declared and initialized to 0. As long as speed is 0 the sprite does not move.

In the create() method each press of 'F' adds 50px/frame cumulatively to the speed. Each press of 'R' subtracts 50px/frame cumulatively from the speed.

Also updated the scene_A information panel for the new feature.




----------------------------------------

>> 5L22:

Refactor code from starting base: "spaceship spin FINAL 5L19-2346 kpe-prj.zip". Improve efficiency and readability expandability of original project.

Using Keolot Phaser Editor (kpe) as my project's visual editor.

Updates from from previous version:


== Replace left and right turn sprites with animations using the rotate sprite.
   In kpe, for for animation objects 'shipTurnLeft' and 'shipTurnRight' replace preload object textures 'ss_turn_left' and 'ss_turn_right' with  preload object texture 'spaceship_rotate'.
   In 'preload' section delete objects ss_turn_left and ss_turn_right.
   In the scene_B canvas objects list for objects sprite_ss_turn_left and sprite_ss_turn_right, change 'texture' to preload object 'spaceship_rotate'. (NOTE: The T-turn key only worked if the sprites were in the list but it was ok to leave the texture setting blank for the sprites. I set them to spaceship_rotate and that worked also.)
   In the file browser delete spaceship_turn_left.png and spaceship_turn_right.png.


== Remove "spaceship_left.png" and instead use 'right facing' "spaceship.png" mirrored to face left.
   In kpe scene_B animaitons objects list for shipFlyLeft change 'texture' to preload-list-obj 'spaceship' instead of "spaceship_left".
   In _B preload-list-objects delete "spaceship_left".
   In kpe scene_B canvas objects list on sprite_ss_left change 'texture' to preload-list-obj 'spaceship' and in the kpe properties panel for the object check the box for "Flip X".
   In the project file browser delete the image file "spaceship_left.png".


== Remove "Matter.js" physics engine from _B canvas object "sprite_ss_rotate" by un-selecting the box for "physics" in the kpe properties panel.
   This was put mistakenly and never removed. No physics engine animations are being used.


== Delete the preload-list-object 'rocket_launch', which is an unused duplicate preload declaraton of the existing 'audio_flyoff' object.


== Remove 'flyoff' and 'return' in-active code and their 'F' and 'R' inactive key bindings.


== For kpe scene_B audio-list-objects, I added "kpe_sceneB_audio_bg", and "kpe_sceneB_audio_jet". These point to project preload-list objects "background_audio" and "audio_flyoff".
   I used ai-gen code in the _B-create()-script and so it did not tie into the kpe audio-list.
   But then I changed the background audio name to "bgMusic" to match the ai code and used the kpe declaration with it in place of the ai declaration.
   And did the same with "flyoffSound".


== Review all comments in the code and improve or reduce where possible.


== Improve 'resize' feature code by using a spriteResizeGroup instead of repeated code for each sprite. See below: "g-ai ref 2".

// g-ai later version of spriteGroup declaration for 'resize' feature. to fix runtime error 5L22.
// Not compatible with previou spriteGroup for 'W-spin' so make 'spriteResizeGroup'
//
this.spriteResizeGroup = this.add.group();
this.spriteResizeGroup.addMultiple([
    this.sprite_spaceship,
    this.sprite_ss_rotate,
    this.sprite_ss_left,
    this.sprite_ss_turn_left,
    this.sprite_ss_turn_right
]);

this.UP.on('up', () => {
    const sprites = this.spriteResizeGroup.getChildren(); // all group sprites array
    if (sprites.length > 0) {
        this.tweens.add({
            targets: sprites,
            scaleX: '*=1.1', // Multiplies current scale by 1.1 (10% increase)
            scaleY: '*=1.1',
            duration: 200,
            ease: 'Sine.inOut'
        });
    }
});

this.DOWN.on('up', () => {
    const sprites = this.spriteResizeGroup.getChildren(); // all group sprites array
    if (sprites.length > 0) {
        this.tweens.add({
            targets: sprites,
            scaleX: '*=.9', // Multiplies current scale by .9 (10% decrease)
            scaleY: '*=.9',
            duration: 200,
            ease: 'Sine.inOut'
        });
    }
});

    if (this.sprite_ss_turn_left) {
    const targetScaleX = this.sprite_ss_turn_left.scaleX * 1.1;
    const targetScaleY = this.sprite_ss_turn_left.scaleY * 1.1;
    this.tweens.add({
      targets: this.sprite_ss_turn_left,
      scaleX: targetScaleX,
      scaleY: targetScaleY,
      duration: 200,

    });
  }
    if (this.sprite_ss_turn_right) {
    const targetScaleX = this.sprite_ss_turn_right.scaleX * 1.1;
    const targetScaleY = this.sprite_ss_turn_right.scaleY * 1.1;
    this.tweens.add({
      targets: this.sprite_ss_turn_right,
      scaleX: targetScaleX,
      scaleY: targetScaleY,
      duration: 200,
      ease: 'Sine.inOut'
    });
  }
 });

You can significantly simplify this by targeting the entire Group inside the tween. In Phaser 3, if you pass a Group or an array as the targets property, the tween will automatically apply the logic to every member of that group.

Here is the rewritten code using spriteGroup:

vvv------------ javascript
this.UP.on('up', () => {
    // Get all children in the group
    const children = this.spriteGroup.getChildren();

    if (children.length > 0) {
        // Calculate the target scale based on the first child's current scale
        const targetScaleX = children[0].scaleX * 1.1;
        const targetScaleY = children[0].scaleY * 1.1;

        this.tweens.add({
            targets: children, // Applies tween to every sprite in the group
            scaleX: targetScaleX,
            scaleY: targetScaleY,
            duration: 200,
            ease: 'Sine.inOut'
        });
    }
});

Why this is better:

Iterative Processing: this.spriteGroup.getChildren() returns an array. The tween engine handles iterating through this array for you.

Scalability: If you add more ship parts (e.g., sprite_ss_engine_glow) to the group later, they will automatically be included in the resizing without needing new code.

Cleanliness: It replaces 20+ lines of repetitive if statements with one block of logic.

Pro-Tip for Mixed Scales:

If the sprites in your group start at different initial scales (e.g., one is 1.0 and one is 0.5), you can use a relative property string to ensure each grows by exactly 10% of its own current size:

vvv------------ javascript
this.tweens.add({
    targets: this.spriteGroup.getChildren(),
    scaleX: '*=1.1', // Multiplies each individual child's scale by 1.1
    scaleY: '*=1.1',
    duration: 200,
    ease: 'Sine.inOut'
});



I ran the code and at runtime I got the following error: Uncaught TypeError: this.spriteGroup.getChildren is not a function

The error Uncaught TypeError: this.spriteGroup.getChildren is not a function usually occurs because the variable this.spriteGroup is not actually a Phaser Group.

How to Fix the Error

Ensure you have initialized the group in your create() method before using it:

vvv------javascript
// In your create() function
this.spriteGroup = this.add.group();

// Add your existing sprites to this group
this.spriteGroup.addMultiple([
    this.sprite_spaceship,
    this.sprite_ss_rotate,
    this.sprite_ss_left,
    this.sprite_ss_turn_left,
    this.sprite_ss_turn_right
]);

Rewritten Optimized Code
Once initialized as a Group, you can use relative scaling ('*=1.1') to increase every sprite's size by 10% from its current scale in a single tween:

vvv------javascript
this.UP.on('up', () => {
    // getChildren() returns an array of all sprites in the group
    const sprites = this.spriteGroup.getChildren();

    if (sprites.length > 0) {
        this.tweens.add({
            targets: sprites,
            scaleX: '*=1.1', // Multiplies current scale by 1.1 (10% increase)
            scaleY: '*=1.1',
            duration: 200,
            ease: 'Sine.inOut'
        });
    }
});

Why use getChildren()?

Mass Targeting: Passing the array from getChildren() to a tween's targets property tells Phaser to apply that animation to every single sprite in the list simultaneously.

Relative Values: Using '*=1.1' is safer than calculating a fixed targetScale. It ensures that if your sprites start at different sizes (e.g., one is 0.5 and another is 1.0), they each grow by 10% of their own size rather than all snapping to the same final scale.

--- g-ai ref 1 (code not used)
__________________________________________________
*** Mirror image the spaceship:  -----------------
--- NONE OF THE G-AI CODE WAS USED ---
   Instead changing the sprite 'flip-x' property in kpe did the complete job.
   In the generated code it looks like:
    this.sprite_ss_left = this.add.sprite(939, 466, 'spaceship');
    ...
    this.sprite_ss_left.setFlipX(true);

In my javascript program using the phaser framework, I have an animation of a spaceship with exhaust flames and the front facing right using the code line "this.sprite_spaceship.play("shipFly");". How can I play this animation as a mirrored animation so that the front is facing left.

To play the animation mirrored so the spaceship faces left, set the sprite's flipX property to true.
vvv------------javascript
this.sprite_spaceship.setFlipX(true);
this.sprite_spaceship.play("shipFly");

Key Methods
setFlipX(true): Flips the sprite horizontally.
setFlipX(false): Returns the sprite to its original right-facing orientation.
toggleFlipX(): Useful if you want to switch directions every time a specific event (like a key press) occurs.

If your spaceship needs to change directions frequently based on movement, you can use a conditional check within your update loop:
vvv------------javascript
if (velocity.x < 0) {
    this.sprite_spaceship.setFlipX(true);
} else if (velocity.x > 0) {
    this.sprite_spaceship.setFlipX(false);
}

*** How can I modify the animation to make it play in reverse?

To play your animation in reverse in Phaser 3, you can use the built-in playReverse method. This is the most efficient way to achieve the effect without needing to create a separate animation key.
Standard Reverse Playback
Replace your current play line with the following to start the animation from the last frame and play backwards to the first:
javascript
this.sprite_spaceship.playReverse("shipFly");
Use code with caution.

Advanced Controls
Toggle Reverse Mid-Animation: If the animation is already playing and you want to switch its direction instantly, use the reverse() method on the animation state:
javascript
this.sprite_spaceship.anims.reverse();
Use code with caution.

Automatic Back-and-Forth: If you want the exhaust flames to play forward and then backward automatically in a loop, set the yoyo property to true when creating your animation:
javascript
this.anims.create({
    key: 'shipFly',
    frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('spaceship', { start: 0, end: 5 }),
    frameRate: 10,
    repeat: -1,
    yoyo: true // Plays 0-5 then 5-0
});
Use code with caution.

Conditional Direction: You can also use play with a configuration object to set the direction dynamically:
javascript
this.sprite_spaceship.play({ key: 'shipFly', reverse: true });
Use code with caution.


This tutorial explains how to listen for animation events, which is helpful if you need to trigger specific logic when a reversed animation reaches its first frame:

*** How can I create a flip effect on a Phaser 3 sprite by scaling it?

In Phaser 3, you can create a flip effect by setting the sprite's horizontal scale (scaleX) to a negative value. While setFlipX(true) is the modern standard for simple mirroring, using scale allows for more complex "squash and stretch" flipping animations.
How to Flip Using Scale
To flip the spaceship so it faces left (mirrored), set its scaleX to -1:
javascript
// Flip horizontally by inverting the X scale
this.sprite_spaceship.setScale(-1, 1);

// To flip and also resize the ship at the same time:
this.sprite_spaceship.setScale(-2, 2); // Flipped and double size
Use code with caution.

Important Considerations
Pivot Point (Origin): Flipping via scale happens around the sprite's origin. If your origin is set to the top-left (0, 0), scaling to -1 will cause the sprite to "jump" to the left of its position. To flip the ship in place, ensure your origin is centered:
javascript
this.sprite_spaceship.setOrigin(0.5); // Centers the pivot point
Use code with caution.

Physics Bodies: If your spaceship has an Arcade Physics body, flipping with setScale(-1) may not automatically flip the hitbox. You might need to manually adjust the body offset or use setFlipX if the hitbox must remain perfectly aligned with the visual.
Tweening the Flip: You can use scale to create a smooth "card flip" or turning effect by tweening the scaleX from 1 to -1:
javascript
this.tweens.add({
    targets: this.sprite_spaceship,
    scaleX: -1,
    duration: 200
});
Use code with caution.
